### About Me

I am a graduate student at **Columbia University** with a passion for finding patterns in complex systems.

My journey started in **Geospatial Data Science** at **UCL**, where I learned to model non-stationary, correlated data in the physical world. I then moved to **Barclays**, where I engineered large-scale Data and GenAI systems for enterprise use.

Now, I am bridging these worlds. I use my engineering background to build better research tools, and my statistical background to **model stochastic and high-dimensional systems**. I am specifically interested in **Quantitative Research**, using modern Deep Learning to uncover signals in alternative and unstructured datasets.
